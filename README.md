# DigitalBoneBox: A Web-Based Study Tool for Human Anatomy

> **An interactive and mobile-friendly anatomy study tool inspired by Prof. Brian Elliott‚Äôs educational work.**

---

## üìñ Overview

**DigitalBoneBox** transforms an existing PowerPoint-based educational tool into a **modern web application** that helps students study human anatomy interactively on any device ‚Äî laptops, tablets, or phones.

## üí° Background: How & Why We Got Here

This project is based on the innovative work of **Prof. Brian Elliott**, developed during his academic journey.

In human anatomy classes, students often need to purchase physical bone sets, which they **cannot take outside the lab**. Prof. Elliott noticed this limitation made it difficult for students to review before exams.

To solve this, he created a **PowerPoint presentation** with:

- High-quality images of bones from multiple angles (with departmental permission)
- **Annotated visuals** using colors and filters to highlight key structures

However, he wanted a more accessible solution ‚Äî a **web-based version** that allows students to:

- Revise quickly before exams
- Quiz themselves on bone anatomy
- Access visual aids on any device, anywhere

Thus, **DigitalBoneBox** was born.
