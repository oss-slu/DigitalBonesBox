### Finding Your First Contribution
Welcome to the DigitalBoneBox project! We're thrilled you're interested in contributing. This guide is designed to help you find and complete your first issue.

### What is a "Good First Issue"?
A "Good First Issue" is a task that has been specifically identified by our team as being a great entry point for new contributors. These issues are typically:

1. Well-defined: The goal is clear and the scope is small.

2. Low-impact: They don't involve changing critical parts of the application.

3. A great learning opportunity: They are a perfect way to get familiar with our codebase, our contribution workflow, and our team.

Examples of good first issues in this project might include:

Fixing a typo in the UI.

Improving the styling of a button or a menu.

Adding a small, self-contained feature, like a "Back to Top" button.

Improving the comments or documentation in a specific part of the code.

### How to Find a Good First Issue
We use a specific label on GitHub to mark these tasks. You can find a good first issue by looking at our wide range of issues created in our repo and identifying an issue tagged "Good First Issue".

### Your First Contribution Workflow
Once you've found an issue that interests you, hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. Claim the Issue: Let everyone know you're working on it! You can assign the issue to yourself by clicking the "assign" button in the sidebar on the right of the issue page. It's also a good idea to leave a quick comment like, "I'd like to work on this!" This helps us avoid having multiple people working on the same thing.
